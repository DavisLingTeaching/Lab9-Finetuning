# Lab9 Finetuning

This lab walks through finetuning an encoder model (distilBERT) for
classification. In particular, we will finetune a model for labeling movie
reviews as positive or negative. A colab notebook is included, if you'd like to
download the notebook and run the code on colab. Note, memory resources pose
some challenges with using colab.

If you'd like to run your code locally, you need to install jupyter lab: 

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

Then you simply run 

```
jupyter lab
```

and open the notebook called `Lab9_Finetuning.ipynb`

The relevant data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18iyGEGz4csxVDUee5gqUafbmvovUBzvr/view?usp=drive_link) and a pretrained model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n6M1LasX02kEe4KYMiNHbbH0-ZIH1Zio/view?usp=drive_link). You can
download these zip files and unzip them in your directory, or you can run the
code blocks that download the files from google drive.
